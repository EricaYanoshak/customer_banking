# Customer Banking System, Module 3 Python Challenge
A Customer Banking System was created using concepts learned during week 3 of class, such as how to create and import functions, pass arguments and variables into functions, create and import classes, create class methods, and instances.

# Description
This project consisted of using Python to code a customer banking system that allows users to calculate and track interest earned on savings and CD accounts. Users can enter their savings and CD account information, see the interest earned, and view the updated balances after a specified number of months by running this application. The steps were broken down into the following three sections:
1. Create the Savings Account Function
2. Create the CD Account Function
3. Create the Main Function

# References Used
To complete this project, I relied heavily on class notes and activities provided during week 3. I also used Jupyter Labs to run Sections 1 and 2 individually to make sure my code output was correct. After confirming that my code was correct, I continued to run Section 3 in Jupyter Labs to ensure that my code was completed correctly.
